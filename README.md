# Restaurant  Order Analysis

This repository contains the SQL scripts and potentially supporting materials for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding restaurant sales patterns, and key business metrics.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze restaurant data to gain insights into various aspects of the business, such as:

* **Sales Trends:** Identifying peak hours, days of the week with the highest sales, and overall revenue performance.
* **Customer Behavior:** Understanding customer ordering patterns, average order value, and potentially customer segmentation (if the data allows).
* **Menu Performance:** Analyzing the popularity and revenue contribution of different menu items.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Exploring factors that might influence order fulfillment time or table turnover (depending on the data available).
* **Identifying Potential Areas for Improvement:** Based on the analysis, suggesting potential strategies for optimizing operations, marketing efforts, or menu offerings.

## Contents

This repository may contain the following:

* **`sql_scripts/` (Directory):**

* **`README.md` (This file):** Provides an overview of the project and instructions for use.

## Data Source

[**Specify the source of your data here.**] For example:

* "The data for this analysis was obtained from a maven analytics official site.
* Visit the [https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?] accessType=open&order=date_added%2Cdesc&search=Restaurant&tags=Business&tags=Retail&tags=Time%20Series"
* "This project uses a publicly available restaurant orders dataset
* "The data was provided in  CSV files."


## Setup and Execution

1. **Database Connection:** Ensure you have access to a MySQL database containing the restaurant data.
2. **SQL Client:** Use a MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, Dbeaver, command-line MySQL client) to execute the SQL scripts.
3. **(Optional) Data Loading:** If the `data_loading.sql` script is present, execute it to populate your database tables.
4. **Execute Analysis Scripts:** Run the scripts in the `sql_scripts/` directory, particularly `exploratory_analysis.sql`, to perform the data analysis. The order of execution might be important (e.g., `data_cleaning.sql` before `exploratory_analysis.sql`).
5. **Review Results:** The results of the SQL queries will provide insights into the restaurant's performance.
